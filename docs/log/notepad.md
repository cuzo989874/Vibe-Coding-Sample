## Current Session Notes: Designing Git Commit Rules and Committing Changes

- User requested to design a Git commit rule.
- User requested to commit all current changes.
- The commit message should follow the newly designed rule.
- **Timecode Limitation:** Currently, I am unable to fetch the precise current time for timestamps in `promptLog.md`. The environment provides only the current date. Therefore, timestamps will default to `12:00 PM (UTC)` for the given date until this capability is enhanced.
