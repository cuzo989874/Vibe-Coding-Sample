# Architectural Analysis: TodoList combined with Calendar Project

This document presents the architectural analysis for the "TodoList combined with Calendar" web application, based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the initial project requirements. The goal is to propose a high-level architecture, technology stack, and data model that aligns with the project's functional and non-functional requirements, adhering to best practices.

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the architectural analysis for the "TodoList combined with Calendar" web application, based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the initial project requirements. The goal is to propose a high-level architecture, technology stack, and data model that aligns with the project's functional and non-functional requirements, adhering to best practices.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

Given the requirements for a web application, individual user focus, local storage, and no backend/monetization, a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** architecture is most suitable. This will be a purely client-side application.

+-------------------+
```

*   **Frontend (SPA):** Will handle all user interactions, UI rendering, business logic, and direct communication with local storage.
*   **Backend:** Not required for this project, as all data is stored locally.
*   **Data Storage:** Browser's local storage (`localStorage` or `IndexedDB`).

## 3. Technology Stack Proposal

Based on the "Material Design Adherence" (UI1.1) and "Web application" (UX1.1) requirements, the following technology stack has been selected:

### 3.1 Core Technologies

*   **Frontend Framework:** **React 18+** - Selected for its component-based architecture, extensive ecosystem, and excellent Material Design library support.
*   **JavaScript Version:** **ES2022+** - Modern JavaScript features without TypeScript complexity.
*   **Build Tool:** **Vite 4+** - Fast development server, efficient bundling, and modern tooling.
*   **Package Manager:** **npm**

### 3.2 UI & Styling

*   **UI Component Library:** **Material-UI (MUI) v5** - Comprehensive React components implementing Material Design.
*   **CSS Architecture:** **CSS Modules** - Scoped styling to prevent conflicts while maintaining flexibility.
*   **Styling Strategy:** 
    - Material-UI components for base UI elements (buttons, dialogs, navigation)
    - CSS Modules for custom components and layout-specific styles
    - Material-UI theme system for consistent color palette and typography

### 3.3 State Management

*   **Primary:** **React Context API** with `useContext` and `useReducer`
*   **Local State:** `useState` for component-level state
*   **Global State:** Context providers for task data, calendar state, and UI preferences
*   **State Structure:** Centralized task management context with reducer pattern for complex state updates

### 3.4 Development Tools

*   **Routing:** **React Router v6** - Client-side routing for SPA navigation
*   **Code Quality:** **ESLint** with React plugin for code linting
*   **Code Formatting:** **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
*   **Development Server:** Vite dev server with hot module replacement

### 3.5 Node.js Environment

*   **Node.js Version:** **18+ LTS** - Required for Vite and modern React development
*   **Browser Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
*   **Development Setup:** Local development environment with live reload

## 4. Data Model

The core entity is a "Task." Based on the requirements, the `Task` data model will be simple:

```javascript
// Task data structure
const Task = {
  id: string,          // Unique identifier (UUID v4)
  title: string,       // Task title (required)
  date: string,        // Due date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
  description: string, // Optional detailed description (can be empty)
  isCompleted: boolean, // Completion status (default: false)
  createdAt: string,  // Creation timestamp "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
  updatedAt: string   // Last modification timestamp "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
};

// State management structure
const AppState = {
  tasks: Task[],           // Array of all tasks
  currentView: string,     // "all" | "pending" | "completed"
  calendarView: string,   // "week" | "month"
  selectedDate: string,   // Currently selected date for calendar
  dialogState: {           // Dialog management
    isOpen: boolean,
    mode: string,          // "create" | "edit" | "view"
    taskId: string | null
  }
};
```

*   **`id`**: Essential for CRUD operations and uniquely identifying tasks.
*   **`title`**: User-provided short description.
*   **`date`**: The date the task is associated with. This will be used for calendar display.
*   **`description`**: Optional longer text for task details.
*   **`isCompleted`**: Boolean to track the completion status (true/false).

## 5. Data Storage Strategy

### 5.1 Storage Mechanism

*   **Primary Storage:** `localStorage` for initial implementation (DS1.1)
*   **Storage Key:** `todoCalendarApp_data` - Single key storing the entire application state
*   **Data Format:** JSON string containing the complete `AppState` object
*   **Size Limit:** `localStorage` has ~5-10MB limit, sufficient for personal task management

### 5.2 Data Operations

*   **Read Operations:** Load entire state from `localStorage` on app initialization
*   **Write Operations:** Save complete state after each modification (simple but effective for small datasets)
*   **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback to empty state if `localStorage` is unavailable
*   **Data Validation:** JSON parsing with error handling and data structure validation

### 5.3 Storage Structure

```javascript
// localStorage structure
localStorage.setItem('todoCalendarApp_data', JSON.stringify({
  tasks: [
    {
      id: "uuid-here",
      title: "Sample Task",
      date: "2025-01-15",
      description: "Task description",
      isCompleted: false,
      createdAt: "2025-01-15 10:30:00",
      updatedAt: "2025-01-15 10:30:00"
    }
  ],
  currentView: "all",
  calendarView: "month",
  selectedDate: "2025-01-15",
  dialogState: {
    isOpen: false,
    mode: null,
    taskId: null
  }
}));
```

### 5.4 Offline Access

*   **Inherent Support:** `localStorage` provides offline access as data resides in the browser
*   **No Network Dependency:** All operations work without internet connection
*   **Data Persistence:** Data persists across browser sessions and device restarts

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements Considerations

*   **Performance (NFR1.1):**
    *   For a single-user, local storage application, performance should be acceptable.
    *   Material-UI components are generally optimized.
    *   Efficient state management and rendering in React will be crucial.
    *   `localStorage` operations are synchronous and can block the main thread if data is very large. This will be monitored, but for typical personal use, it should not be an issue.
*   **Scalability (NFR1.2):** Not a primary concern as per requirements. The chosen architecture (SPA with local storage) is inherently limited in multi-user scalability.
*   **Accessibility (NFR1.3):** Material-UI components come with built-in accessibility features. Adhering to semantic HTML and ARIA attributes during custom component development will ensure compliance.
*   **Reliability & Availability (NFR1.4):** As a client-side application, reliability depends on the user's browser and device. Data availability is tied to `localStorage` integrity. No server-side availability concerns.

## 7. Frontend Component Breakdown (High-Level)

*   **App Component:** Main entry point, handles routing.
*   **Header/Navigation Component:** For switching between task lists and calendar views.
*   **TodoList Component:** Displays task lists (All, Pending, Completed).
*   **Calendar Component:** Displays week/month views, integrates with tasks.
*   **TaskDialog Component:** Reusable Dialog for creating, viewing, and updating tasks.
*   **TaskItem Component:** Displays individual task details in lists and calendar.

## 8. Conclusion

The proposed SPA architecture with React.js and Material-UI, utilizing `localStorage` for data, provides a robust and efficient solution that directly addresses all specified functional and non-functional requirements for the "TodoList combined with Calendar" project. This design prioritizes simplicity and adherence to Material Design principles for an individual user web application.
