# Architectural Analysis: TodoList combined with Calendar Project

This document presents the architectural analysis for the "TodoList combined with Calendar" web application, based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the initial project requirements. The goal is to propose a high-level architecture, technology stack, and data model that aligns with the project's functional and non-functional requirements, adhering to best practices.

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the architectural analysis for the "TodoList combined with Calendar" web application, based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the initial project requirements. The goal is to propose a high-level architecture, technology stack, and data model that aligns with the project's functional and non-functional requirements, adhering to best practices.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

Given the requirements for a web application, individual user focus, local storage, and no backend/monetization, a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** architecture is most suitable. This will be a purely client-side application.

+-------------------+
```

*   **Frontend (SPA):** Will handle all user interactions, UI rendering, business logic, and direct communication with local storage.
*   **Backend:** Not required for this project, as all data is stored locally.
*   **Data Storage:** Browser's local storage (`localStorage` or `IndexedDB`).

## 3. Technology Stack Proposal

Based on the "Material Design Adherence" (UI1.1) and "Web application" (UX1.1) requirements, a modern JavaScript frontend framework is recommended.

*   **Frontend Framework:** **React.js** (or Vue.js/Angular) is a strong candidate due to its component-based architecture, large ecosystem, and excellent support for Material Design libraries.
*   **UI Component Library:** **Material-UI (MUI)** for React. This library provides a comprehensive set of React components that implement Material Design, ensuring adherence to the design preference.
*   **State Management:** For a project of this scope, React's built-in `useState` and `useContext` hooks should suffice. For more complex state, a library like Zustand or Jotai could be considered, but initially, simpler solutions are preferred.
*   **Routing:** React Router for navigation between different views (e.g., calendar views, task lists).
*   **Build Tool:** Vite or Create React App (CRA) for project scaffolding and development server. Vite is generally faster and more modern.

## 4. Data Model

The core entity is a "Task." Based on the requirements, the `Task` data model will be simple:

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;          // Unique identifier for the task (e.g., UUID)
  title: string;       // Task title (e.g., "Buy groceries")
  date: string;        // Due date of the task (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD")
  description: string; // Optional detailed description
  isCompleted: boolean; // Completion status (true/false)
}
```

*   **`id`**: Essential for CRUD operations and uniquely identifying tasks.
*   **`title`**: User-provided short description.
*   **`date`**: The date the task is associated with. This will be used for calendar display.
*   **`description`**: Optional longer text for task details.
*   **`isCompleted`**: Boolean to track the completion status (true/false).

## 5. Data Storage Strategy

*   **Mechanism:** `localStorage` will be used for initial implementation (DS1.1).
*   **Structure:** Tasks will be stored as a JSON string in `localStorage`. A single key (e.g., `todoCalendarTasks`) could store an array of `Task` objects.
*   **Operations:** All CRUD operations will involve reading the entire array from `localStorage`, modifying it in memory, and then writing the entire updated array back to `localStorage`.
*   **Offline Access (DS1.2):** `localStorage` inherently supports offline access as data resides in the browser.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements Considerations

*   **Performance (NFR1.1):**
    *   For a single-user, local storage application, performance should be acceptable.
    *   Material-UI components are generally optimized.
    *   Efficient state management and rendering in React will be crucial.
    *   `localStorage` operations are synchronous and can block the main thread if data is very large. This will be monitored, but for typical personal use, it should not be an issue.
*   **Scalability (NFR1.2):** Not a primary concern as per requirements. The chosen architecture (SPA with local storage) is inherently limited in multi-user scalability.
*   **Accessibility (NFR1.3):** Material-UI components come with built-in accessibility features. Adhering to semantic HTML and ARIA attributes during custom component development will ensure compliance.
*   **Reliability & Availability (NFR1.4):** As a client-side application, reliability depends on the user's browser and device. Data availability is tied to `localStorage` integrity. No server-side availability concerns.

## 7. Frontend Component Breakdown (High-Level)

*   **App Component:** Main entry point, handles routing.
*   **Header/Navigation Component:** For switching between task lists and calendar views.
*   **TodoList Component:** Displays task lists (All, Pending, Completed).
*   **Calendar Component:** Displays week/month views, integrates with tasks.
*   **TaskDialog Component:** Reusable Dialog for creating, viewing, and updating tasks.
*   **TaskItem Component:** Displays individual task details in lists and calendar.

## 8. Conclusion

The proposed SPA architecture with React.js and Material-UI, utilizing `localStorage` for data, provides a robust and efficient solution that directly addresses all specified functional and non-functional requirements for the "TodoList combined with Calendar" project. This design prioritizes simplicity and adherence to Material Design principles for an individual user web application.
