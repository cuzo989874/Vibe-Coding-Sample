# Project Requirements: TodoList combined with Calendar

This document outlines the finalized requirements for the "TodoList combined with Calendar Project," derived from detailed discussions and clarifications with the user. These requirements will serve as the foundational blueprint for subsequent development phases.

## 1. Core Functionality

### 1.1 TodoList Module

*   **Task Management (CRUD):** The system shall support the creation, reading (viewing), updating, and deletion of tasks.
*   **Task Views:** The system shall provide three distinct views for tasks:
    *   "All Tasks" (所有任務)
    *   "Pending Tasks" (未完成任務)
    *   "Completed Tasks" (已完成任務)
*   **Task Attributes:** Each task shall include the following attributes:
    *   Title (標題)
    *   Date (日期)
    *   Description (描述)
*   **Task Status Management:** The completion status of a task shall be managed via a checkbox. Clicking the checkbox will toggle the task's completion status.
*   **Time/Range Exclusion:** Tasks shall not include specific times or time ranges.

### 1.2 Calendar Module

*   **Event Viewing:** Clicking on an event (which represents a task) on the calendar shall display its detailed information.
*   **Task Creation Entry Point:** Clicking on an empty space or a date number within the calendar shall navigate the user to the task creation page, pre-populating the selected date.
*   **Calendar Views:** The calendar shall provide two distinct views:
    *   "Week View" (週視圖)
    *   "Month View" (月視圖)
*   **Integration Scope:** The calendar's responsibility is limited to displaying tasks and facilitating task creation. It shall not include complex event management functionalities beyond this scope.

## 2. User Experience & Interface

*   **Target User:** The application is designed for individual users.
*   **Interface Type:** The application shall be a Web application.
*   **Design Preference:** The application shall adhere to Material Design principles. During technical selection, UI frameworks offering Material Design components will be prioritized.
*   **Key User Flows:**
    *   Users shall be able to quickly add a task and view it on their calendar.
    *   Users shall be able to quickly view their tasks for today/tomorrow, categorized as pending, completed, or all tasks.
    *   When browsing the daily task list, users shall be able to quickly add a new task and see it appear in the list.
*   **Task Editing Flow:** Task details, creation, and update operations shall be implemented using Dialog (對話框) components.
*   **Visual Distinction (Calendar):** Tasks and other potential calendar events shall be visually distinguishable. For instance, generic events could be displayed as text, while tasks are represented by small blocks with a background color.

## 3. Data & Storage

*   **Storage Mechanism:** Data shall be stored locally. The initial implementation will utilize the browser's `localStorage` for simplicity.
*   **Offline Access:** The application shall support offline access.
*   **Data Privacy & Security:** No specific privacy or security considerations beyond standard browser-based local storage practices are required.
*   **Data Persistence/Backup/Migration:** Data persistence, backup, or cross-browser/device migration are not within the current scope.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** No specific performance requirements have been identified.
*   **Scalability:** No specific scalability requirements have been identified.
*   **Accessibility:** The application shall adhere to general accessibility guidelines.
*   **Reliability & Availability:** No specific reliability or availability expectations have been identified.

## 5. Business Model

*   **Project Nature:** This is a personal project.
*   **Monetization Strategy:** No monetization strategy is planned.
