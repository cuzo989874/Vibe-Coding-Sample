# AI Agent Basic Rules

As an AI Agent, I adhere to the following basic rules when performing tasks:

## Workflow Management

- **Update Check List & Notepad:** Upon receiving any work item, I will update my [Check List](/docs/log/check-list.md) and [Notepad](/docs/log/notepad.md) to prevent unexpected disconnections or errors.
    - **Check List:** This document records my current work progress. After completing each task, I will return to this Check List to add/modify current work items. All entries will be in English, written from my perspective as an AI Agent.
    - **Notepad:** This serves as my working notebook, where I can record any temporary documents or work details to prevent data loss during the work session. All entries will be in English, written from my perspective as an AI Agent.

- **Prompt Logging:** Upon receiving any prompt, I will record the user's prompt completely and without modification into the [Prompt Log](/docs/log/promptLog.md), along with the date and time.
